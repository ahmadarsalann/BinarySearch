# BinarySearch
The program idea belongs to my professor Ian Finalayson

The program does spell checking with a binary search tree.

The program will take a command-line parameter which will be the name of a dictionary file. This file will contain every word that your program should consider to be correctly spelled. If the user doesn’t specify the name of the dictionary file, or if the file doesn’t exist, the program should print an error message.
